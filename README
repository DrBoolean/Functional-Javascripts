Lots of functional libs all modified to work with web/titanium/node environments.

Oliver Steele's functional library: http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/

Sjoerd Visscher's algebraic data type library: http://w3future.com/weblog/stories/2008/06/16/adtinjs.xml

Bram Stein's matching library: http://www.bramstein.com/

Probably needs better organization...

Feel free to chip in!
